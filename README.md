<h1> Source code </h1>
<p> Source code is all included in the firstTriangle folder as well as some Visual Studio 2022 project files. </p>

<h1> Running it </h1>
<p> You can either build it yourself by opening the .sln file and running it in Visual Studio 2022 or download an executable binary from the release page. </p>

<h1> Error Message? </h1>
<p> There should be no error messages, but if you get "opengl32.lib could not be found", you will have to download it. Visual Studio 2022 comes with it, and I believe the Windows SDK does as well. </p>
  
<h1> Other information </h1>
<p> The include directory contains the necessary files for glad and glfw. The lib directory contains the necessary static libraries for x86 and x86 glfw that the program links to. </p>
